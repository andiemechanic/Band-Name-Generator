# Band-Name-Generator
My friend is always trying to think of band names, so I made this random word generator for him to do so.
It's made using webpack, and an npm package called [random-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-words).
I would've loved if I could detect the parts of speech in each word to then match up pairs of adjectives and nouns or something, but it felt a bit above me.

_**Enjoy!**_
